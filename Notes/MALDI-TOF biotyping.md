## MALDI-TOF Biotyping
Quick and easy identification based on protein profiles without the necessity for genomic information using [[Ionization (MALDI)|MALDI MS]]. Fast and easy, good for field work.

- Single colonies are picked from cultures
- Quick protein extraction with 10% formic acid
- Spotting on MALDI plate
- Protein profile measurement with MALDI MS
- MS profile comparison to databases containing standard profiles of a variety of related microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, etc.)
