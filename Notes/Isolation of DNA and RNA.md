## Classical Isolation of DNA/RNA from bacterial cell extract
![[Pasted image 20210812140825.png]]
Steps:
1. Cell lysis (disruption of the cell wall)--> Cell extract
2. Centrifugation --> Separation of cell extract in cell debris and supernatant. Collect supernatant as it contains DNA, RNA and proteins
3. Mix with __phenol__ --> Precipitation of proteins
4. Centrifugation --> Protein preciptation coagulates at the interface between aqueous and lipid phase
5. Aqueous phase: nucleic acids

## Separation of RNA and DNA
Lowering of pH < 5 --> DNA has a tendency to move into the organic phenol phase, RNA not so much.

## Ethanol precipitation of DNA (and RNA?)

a) DNA can be spooled with a glass rod
b) DNA can be precipitated out of solution ==for the removal of salts and/or for resuspension in an alternative buffer.== Either ethanol (>=70% v/v) or isopropanol (>=50% v/v) can be used to achieve this purpose; however, the use of ethanol is generally preferred. Cations, provided as salts, are typically included to neutralize the negative charge of the DNA phosphate backbone.

## Plasmid isolation
1. [[Alkaline lysis]]: Peletting out of linear DNA molecules at pH 12-12.5
2. [[Chromatography with silica membranes and chaotropic ions]]: Chaotropic agents (such as CTAB) remove hydrate shell around the DNA, which then binds to hydrophilic silica gel 
3. [[Ion-exchange chromatography]]: Binding of DNA under low and release under high salt concentrations


But watch out! As far as I am concerned, 2&3 work with all sorts of DNA? ANd RNA?
