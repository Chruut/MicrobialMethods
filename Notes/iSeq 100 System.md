- Clusters are formed in nanowells which are fabricated over __CMOS photodiodes__. 
- During sequencing, CMOS sensors detect light emissions at the bottom of the wells during each imaging step

## Advantages (compared to non-CMOS)
- Lower instrument costs
- Simplified NGS chemistry and optics
- Shorter imaging time
- Smaller instrument footprint
- Clustering and sequencing all in one instrument
