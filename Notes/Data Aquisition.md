There is a big variety in Mass Spectrometers for analysis of __precursors__ (before digestion) and also the __fragments__ resulting from digestion.

Different techniques:
- ICR
- Quadrupoles
- Iontrap
- Combinations

Mass-to-charge ration (m/z) is measured. This means that if a particle doesn't bear a net charge it's not registered. Each charge (proton) added during ionization adds 1Da. 

### Mass analyzers
- In the TOF mass analyzer, the longer it takes for a ion to reach the detector, the bigger is its m/z. 
- [[Orbitrap]]

The Orbitrap produces high resolution mass spectra, the ion trap low resolution. Peptides with similar structures will not be separated by the ion trap. 


## How fragmentation works

Different MS2 fragmentation techniques, divide the peptide in different parts.

Most often b,y ions are produced via __CID__, __PSD__, __HCD__ or __IRMPD__. These are created by division of the actual peptide bond:

ETD and ECD create c,z ions:
