## PCR-ESI-MS
- Identification of microbes (Isolates) based on barcodes.
- Use of 16S ribosomal DNA, resistance genes, house keeping genes, etc. as gene tags for identification (variable regions flanked by conserved regions). 
- PCR is done for these specific DNA regions --> enrichment of amplicons. 
- These amplicons (DNA) are then put through high precision ESI-MS which allows to identify the frequency of each base (C,G,A,T) which is compared to databases containing base compositions of a variety of related microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, etc.) for identification.
- Faster than Biotyping!
- Requires isolates?
