- Based on hydrogen ions released during the DNA polymerisation
- NGS libraries are first captured on beads (one fragment per bead): A water-in-oil emulsion containing PCR reagents and one bead per droplet is created to amplify each fragment individually. Subsequently, DNA is denatured and the beads, containing one amplified DNA fragment each, are distributed into the __wells of a fiberoptic slide__ (one bead per well).
- These wells are miniature pH-meters 
- The four nucleotides are washed through the flowcells (wells) in an alternating fashion and whenever a nucleotide is integrated using the polymerase the pH change is detected. 
- __Homopolymers__ (sequences of the same nucleotide in series) result in bigger pH changes
