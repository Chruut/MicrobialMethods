## Mass cytometry (CyTOF)
Usage of ABs labeled with isotopes targeting specific proteins of interest (<100 analytes)  allowing for quantification.

Mass cytometry offers high-content cytometric analysis by exploiting the resolution, sensitivity and dynamic range of mass spectrometry on a time-scale that allows the measurement of 1000 individual cells per second. Single-cell analysis of at least 45 simultaneous parameters without fluorescent agents (and therefore no interference from spectral overlap). Instead, stable, non-radioactive isotopes of non-biological rare earth metals and lanthanides are used as reporters. 

Mass cytometry has essentially the same workflow as conventional flow cytometry. Cells are stained with target-specific antibodies labeled with the metal isotopes. These are the same antibody clones used in conventional cytometry. In the instrument, cells are being atomized and ionized resulting in ion clouds which are transferred into the high vacuum of the MS. Specific low mass range is
scanned by the MS, which is done by qTOF (quadrupole filtering). Can be used to follow signaling cascades, cell surface makers, marker proteins etc. by time, during treatment or in different cell types.
