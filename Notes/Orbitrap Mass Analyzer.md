Ions which made it through the MS, coming from the C-trap are trapped in an orbital motion around the spindle and produce a oscillating pattern in the measured in the current of the outer electrode. The obtained frequency signals are converted by Fourier Transformation.

Orbitraps belong to the family of FTMS devices like the __Fourier Transformation Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FTICR)__.
