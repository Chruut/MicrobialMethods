 Proteins are not soluble when highly expressed. They can be made soluble by: 
 - [Fusing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fusion_protein) them to __soluble domains ([MBP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Maltose-binding_protein))__. 

- Proper translation may require additional tRNAs (Rosetta). 
- Correct protein folding may require special chaperones. 

- Try weaker induction
- Lower temperatures during protein expression (e.g. E. coli ArcticExpress (DE3))
