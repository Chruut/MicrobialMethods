## Dideoxy sequencing

- Based on selective incorporation of labeled chain terminating dideoxynucleotides (by DNA pol) and subsequent electrophoresis
- __Serial__ Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS)

- [[Sanger sequencing]]

1st vs. 2nd generation:

## 2nd (Next) generation sequencing (NGS)
- __Parallel__ Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS) --> high throughput
- No electrophoresis needed
- No cloning into vectors. Instead adaptors are ligated onto the fragmented DNA, serving as priming sites --> sequence library
- Clusters of PCR generated (identical) DNA fragments are called __colonies__. Templates are amplified to magnify fluorescence signals
- Simultaneous sequencing of many fragments --> Massive parallel sequencing, Shotgun sequencing
- Produce shorter reads (up to 600bp)


- [[Illumina sequencing]]
- [[Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection (SOLiD)]]
- [[Ion Torrent]]
- Pyrosequencing
## 3rd generation sequencing (TGS)
- Significantly longer reads
- Template doesn't require amplification (only a single template is required)


- [[PacBIO Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT)]]
- [[Oxford Nanopore Technology (ORT)]]
