## Definitions

__Microbiota__: All microorganisms in an environment identified by 16S rRNA surveys
__Metagenome__: All genes and genomes in an environment (including plasmids) --> genetic potential
__Microbiome__: All genes and genomes in an environment, as well as the products of microbiota and host 
__Hologenome__: There is a core microbiome consisting of core taxa, well adapted (and specialized) to living in the host's environment. Further there's a flexible pool. These are assoziated with the host and adapted, but they're also found in the environment. Finally there's a environmental part of the microbiome. These are not adapted to the host, but can live with it under certain conditions.

## Analysis of microbial communities

### Difficulties
The taxonomic identification is often only achieved on the level of families and orders, while important functional properties are exhibited on the strain level.
