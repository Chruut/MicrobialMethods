# Microarrays
Used to quantify RNA levels in a comparison of two conditions. It relies on hybridization of labeled cDNA with a singlestranded probe which is immobilized in wells of an array, each probe representing a particular gene

The cDNA is labeled using a fluorophore (different fluorophores depending on the condition in which they were generated), the intensity of which measures the number of certain transcripts in a sample. The microarray can be used to look at gene expression conditions A+B simultaneously. A yellow signal means that the gene expression is equal between conditions A+B. 

==Microarray analysis is mostly replaced through high-throughput sequencing nowadays!==

## (Dis-)advantages
- Microarray plates need to be designed in advance, so you need to know the sequences you're testing for
- High throughput: Microarrays can potentially profile transcript of entire genomes, while qPCR can only analyze a handful of genes at a time. But microarrays require knowledge of the gene sequences (a reference genome).

## Applications
Microarrays can be used to detect:
- Genomic DNA
- Protein-DNA interactions
- Transcripts (differential gene expression or also interruption of whole pathways/gene sets)
- Identification of subtypes and predictions based on characteristic transcript patterns in different states of the cell
