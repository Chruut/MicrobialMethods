## Introduction

Assessing the vast _spatio-temporal diversity_ of the dynamic system in host-microbe interaction is a difficult challenge. Depending on its milieu (different cell types, organs) bacteria of the same species can have varying phenotypes and due to the reactive nature of an immune system to an invasive bacterium, cell abundances constantly fluctuate. Complexity increases exponentially if we want to study their interaction together. 

Studies in population dynamics quantify parameters which describe such interactions, which is only possible with high experimental throughput. In studies of hostâ€“bacterial interactions, the success of microbial colonization is traditionally assessed by selective plating of homogenized organs on agar plates, which are permissive for the growth of the bacterium of interest. In some cases, [[qPCR]] or [[16S-sequencing]] have also been employed. However, these methods only capture snapshots and if they require to kill the host for sample extraction, this is generally rather impractical (also the case with [[Neutral genetic tags]], however..).

Population dynamics describe the kinetics of changes in the structure of a population, for example regarding age, developmental stage, disease state, phenotypic manifestation or localization

### Non-neutral methods
The following methods are not completely fitness neutral. For instance the prooduction of fluorescent markers requires energy to produce and the accumulation of the proteins can have a cytotoxic effect. The issues for the other methods are similar.

- [[Fluorescent Reporters]] (TIMER plasmid)
- [[Antibiotic Markers]]
- [[pAM34 plasmid]]
- [Serotypes](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Serotyp#:~:text=Als%20Serotypen%20bezeichnet%20man%20Untergruppen,epidemiologischer%20Sicht%20von%20Interesse%20ist.) (recognition by different antigens)
- Phenotype

An ideal marker should be tracable, inheritable and should not impact the organisms fitness! Even looking at natural polymorphisms (phenotype) is not suitable for analysis because these polymorphisms are not necessarily neutral, so it can be difficult to distinguish between genetic drift from selection. 
### Neutral methods
- [[Neutral genetic tags]]
