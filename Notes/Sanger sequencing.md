- Based on PCR reaction with selective incorporation of labeled __chain terminating dideoxynucleotides__ together with normal dNTPs (by DNA pol) and subsequent electrophoresis
- Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS)
- Only one template at the time --> Serial method
- 400 - 900 bp sequencing capacity
- Cloning of bigger fragments requires cloning and subcloning --> Tedious
- Nucleotides/terminators are not removable
- Uses DNA amplification and originally required the template to be on plasmids which have known sites for efficient primer binding and allow for singlestranded DNA synthesis. Nowadays direct templates can be used due to advances in recombinant techniques
- PCR based, but only ssDNA is generated through several cycles of repeated heating and cooling --> amplification of the fluorescence signal
- From the early methods only sanger sequencing is still used today --> de novo shotgun sequencing (sequencing of small fragments and then piece them together by aligning overlapping sequences) is used for [genotyping](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Genotyping), sequence confirmation of a cloned DNA fragment

- Dideoxynucleotides lack the 3' OH which is necessary for the diesterbond between two nulceotides --> sequence termination
- The specific nucleotides (A, T, C, G) are labeled with different fluorophores
- The chain elongation reaction produces fragments of different lengths
-  Today these products are resolved by __Capilary Electrophoresis__ based on their length. As the fragments run along the capilary, their fluorescent emission is detected 
-  Electropherogram = Trace, displays the intensity of the fluorescence signal and the corresponding base. Each peak corresponds to numerous fragments terminated at the same base
