"The average MS signal response for the three most intense tryptic peptides is calculated for each well characterized protein in the mixture, including those to the internal standard protein(s). The average MS signal response from the internal standard protein(s) is used to determine a universal signal response factor (counts/mol of protein), which is then applied to the other identified proteins in the mixture to determine their corresponding absolute concentration. The absolute quantity of each well characterized protein in the mixture is determined by dividing the average MS signal response of the three most intense tryptic peptides of each well characterized protein by the universal signal response factor described above."

In LCMS(E) all spikes in the MS spectra are selected as precursor for a subsequent MS/MS scan resulting in lower peak intensity dependence of peptide identification as is the case for conventional data-dependent MS/MS scans. If the MS device allows this kind of detection mode it is preferable to xPAI, but it is still presented with the mentioned basic challenges of this approach.
