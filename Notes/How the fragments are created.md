In  a double-charged peptide, one charge is delocalized of the Pi-System of the peptide bonds. Based on the position of this charge at the moment of fragmentation,  fragments of different lengths are produced. The N-term fragment is called __b-ion__, the C-term fragment is the __y-ion__.

In the end you get a combined mass spectra of b-, y- and some a-ions (up to  70000 spectra/h)
