## Ionization techniques
In mass spectrometry, ionization refers to the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the [ion source](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ion_source). There are several [ion sources](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ion_source) available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications:
### Hard ionization
Transmit high amounts of energy into the subject molecule, invoking large degrees of fragmentation. Resultant ions tend to have _m/z_ lower than the molecular mass.

- [[Electron Ionization (EI)]]

### Soft ionization 
Ionization process doesn't break up the molecules 

Most prominent:
- [[Ionization (MALDI)]]
- [[Electrospray Ionization (ESI)]]

## Applications
Comparison of m/z of 13C cultured to normal cultures allows for determination of #Cs. This norrows down choices drastically. 
Inverse feeding: Feeding a known substance as a substrate to 13C cultured cells shows incorporation by #C mass shift
Reactions which use ATP as a substrate in a reversable manner can be indicated to be successful by adding 18O-gamma-P-ATP.
Reactions which use water as a substrate can be indicated by using Deuterium (D2O)
When in a reaction some Atom incorporation is happening and multiple possible reaction mechanisms are possible, it's possible to determine the correct one by differentiation of substrate source. 

1. The determination of a correct sum formulae (f.i. The relative abundance of X+1 C-isotopes allows to estimate the number of Cs in an observed molecule which narrows down the list of possible candidates enormously ). 


Having the sum formula in combination with knowledge about biosynthetic genes one can draw conclusions about the building blocks of the compound

Inverse feeding appraoch: You can test whether a certain molecule is used as a substrate (building block) for the synthesis of your compound of interest by cultivating the culture in 3 different media: 12C, 13C (Isogro) and 13C + 12C substrate and compare the peaks

2. Pyrophosphate exchange assay: The determination of adenylation domain specificties in NRPS enzymes

An adenylation domain is a catalytic domain in a non-ribosomal synthetase. These are huge multienzyme complexes which can produce small peptides independent of ribosomes. They are organized in modules (a unit that encorporates one AA into a peptide backbone). A module consists of three domains: C = condensation domain (catalyzes the peptide bond formation), PCP = Peptidyl Carrier Protein (binds the growing peptide), A = Adenylation domain (selectively selects and activates the AA to be attached). 10 out of 550aa of the A domain are responsible for substrate specificity, as they are involved in pocket formation to bind the aa. These 10 can be used to predict specificity.

3. The determination of D-amino acids in RIPPs

RIPPs have D-amino acids. Marfey is a commonly used method to distinguish presence of L- and D-amino acids. But with Marfey positional information about the peptide sequence is lost and sufficient amounts of pure peptide are needed (to avoid cross contamination by other peptides). To get the positional information we use ODIS, where together with Deuterium SAM epimerase labeling the peptide is fragmented into sub-aa parts and the masshift then indicates the exact position of the Deuterium (epimerase event).
