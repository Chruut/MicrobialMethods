### 5'-end labeling with PNK
- __Polynucleotide kinase (PNK)__ (from bacteriophage T4) can transfer a radiolabeled _gamma-phosphate_ of a radiolabeled ATP to the 5'-ends of  DNA. 
- Commonly used radioactive P isotopes are P-32 (half life: 14d) and P-33 (half life: 25d)
- [[Alkaline phosphatase]] can be used to remove phosphate groups from 5' ends, prior to labeling with PNK.
