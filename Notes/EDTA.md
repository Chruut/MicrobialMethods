In the laboratory, EDTA is widely used for scavenging metal ions: 
- Deactivation of metal-depending enzymes to suppress damage to DNA and polysaccharides
- EDTA acts as a selective against dNTP hydrolyzing enzymes ([Taq polymerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taq_polymerase "Taq polymerase"), [dUTPase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUTP_diphosphatase "DUTP diphosphatase"), MutT, [liver arginase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginase "Arginase") and [horseradish peroxidase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseradish_peroxidase "Horseradish peroxidase")) independently of metal ion [chelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation "Chelation").
- In analytical chemistry, EDTA is used in [complexometric titrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexometric_titration "Complexometric titration") and analysis of water hardness or as a [masking agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masking_agent "Masking agent") to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses
