= Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS)
but != Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS)

Allows to map local concentrations of an analyte in a tissue


## Practical Information
- Matrix has to be applied with a coating of fine droplets so that the crystals are applied homogenously
- Bigger droplets lead to good extraction, but low spatial resolution due to delocalisation of analytes into the solvent/matrix
- Smaller droplets lead to bad extraction, but high spatial resolution

- Laser ablation size has to be same size as the chosen pixel size for MS analysis. Every pixel represents a full MS analysis of the applied MS range. If laser ablation area is bigger than the defined pixel  --> __Oversampling__ (bottom left), diminished spatial resolution. If it's smaller --> __Undersampling__ (bottom right), low spectral gain
