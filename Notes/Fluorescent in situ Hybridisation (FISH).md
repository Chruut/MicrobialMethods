FISH uses fluorescent probes that bind only to certain parts of a nucleic acid sequence with a high degree of sequence complementarity. __Fluorescence microscopy__ can be used to localize the probes within the cell and for species identification.

1.  Fix and permeabilize cells from environmental sample, so that the probe can enter the cells
2.  Hybridization by the oligonucleotide probe (recognizes a specific barcode) --> labeled cells
3.  Can be analyzed by microscopy or flow cytometry (sorted and counted based on their fluorescence)

- Instead of oligonucleotide probes antibodies can also be used
- FISH can also detect and localize specific RNA targets (mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, etc. ). In this context, it can help define the spatial-temporal patterns of gene expression within cells and tissues.

## Disadvantages
- The probes are often not specific enough to identify specific species.
- Probes need to be generated. Targeted approach only
