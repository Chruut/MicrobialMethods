Analysis of community composition by comparison of Species Hypotheses (sequenced) between populations cultured in isotope-medium and normal medium. 
Quantification by [[Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)|qPCR]]
1.  Incubate your sample in either 18O-enriched H2O or 13C-glucose (incorporation into the DNA)
2.  Extraction of DNA
3.  Separation based on density gradient
4.  Collect the different fractions
5.  Analysis of the microbial community (sequencing + [[Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)|qPCR]])
6.  Compare the patterns between labeled and unlabeled samples
