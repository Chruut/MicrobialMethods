# Protein level
- [[Detection|Western Blot]]
- [[Proteomics|Proteomics]]: Indicates the levels of all known proteins in the sample
- [[Reporter gene fusions]] (transcriptional or translational)

# RNA level
RNA hybridization methods:
-  [[Northern Blot]]
-  [[Microarrays]]

Amplification methods:
- [[Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)]]

Sequencing methods:
- [[RNA-Seq]] (incl. Translatome)


Although gene transcription is coupled to translation in bacteria, we can never be too sure about what is being actually being translated.
