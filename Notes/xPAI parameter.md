xPAI = extracted ion intensity-based protein abundance index

XPAI describes a parameter to express protein concentrations without the need of introducing labels or internal standards. 
## Process
A known quantity of a defined protein is added into the complex which is then trypsin digested. The averaged intensities of the three most intense resulting of this proteins is used as a universal signal response factor in the form of "counts/mol of protein" (the xPAI), which is then applied to the other identified proteins in the mixture to determine their corresponding absolute concentration. The absolute quantity of each well characterized protein in the mixture is determined by dividing the average MS signal response of the three most intense tryptic peptides of each well characterized protein by the universal signal response factor described above.

## Dis-/Advantages
It has been shown to correlate well with known protein concentrations in the human RNA polymerase II complex and rat mitochondria. However, xPAI is limited to samples of low complexity since selection of only the three most intense peptides becomes unreliable with an increasing number of different proteins in the sample. Additionally, it is difficult to apply the xPAI approach to samples which were pre-fractionated at the peptide level, due to carry-over effects between the different fractions
