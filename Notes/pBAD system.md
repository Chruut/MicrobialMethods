- The __pBAD-system__ utilizes an __arabinose-inducible promoter__ and contains an __araC gene__ which encodes an arabinose-response regulatory protein AraC.

- The AraC proteins form a dimer through interactions with their N-terminal domains and have domains at their C-terminus which interact with the pBAD operator sequences (I1, O2) and through these interactions mediate repression or activation. 
- Arabinose binding to AraC causes the C-terminal domain to dissociate from the O2-operator and allows AraC to bind both I1 and I2 operators, leading to expression. 
- The pBAD promoters are additionally controled by the Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP, cAMP receptor protein) and thus displays __catabolite repression__, for instance in the presence of glucose.

- Protein expression is tunable in the right host. To use this vector one first has to ensure that the host bears the __AraE gene__, which encodes for an __arabinose transporter__.
