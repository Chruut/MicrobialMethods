Constructed by a frame with different compartments which are connected by a gel with a __pH-gradient__. When applying a voltage, each protein/peptide tries to find the compartement which matches its isoelectric point where it doesn't experiences any electrical force anymore. 

- 100ug to 5mg protein/peptide sample to 12-24 fractions
- Can be applied to proteins and peptides
- pH-fractionation has a resolution of 0.1-0.6 pH
- The analytes accumulate in the gel and also partially in the supernatant, which makes it easy to pipette out different fractions --> easy transfer to LC/MS
- Up to 16 simultaneous sample fractions
- ug to mg load capacity
- Running conventional in-gel IEF is also possible
