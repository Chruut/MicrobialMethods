# General principle
From simple genotyping of a community, you get all sorts of genomic material and you don't know which stems from living cells. Feeding your microorganisms with stable isotopes (f.i. N15), this creates DNA that is heavier than normal DNA (N14) which can be __separated by density gradient centrifugation__. Just extract genomic DNA.

# Identification of active microbes in a community

You expose them to heavy isotopes and separate barcodes by its density gradient. Then you collect the different fractions and analyze the community in the different fractions based on those which have been fed the normal isotopes and those which got the heavy ones.
