Reporter fusions are used for studying gene expression on two levels: 
- In __transcriptional fusion__ it is used to study promoter activity by fusing a promoter to the reporter gene.
- __Translational fusion__ is achieved by fusing the reporter gene to the entire gene of interest (or just a part of it). It is used to monitor whether the gene is translated. The fusion __must be in frame__ in order to yield a functional reporter gene product!

# Enzyme Assays (LacZ, GusA)

LacZ (Beta-Galactosidase) is used to screen for __bacteria which have taken up a plasmid which allows them to digest X-Gal into a Blue dye__ (together with Galactose). For this the [[pUC18 & pUC19]] plasmids can be used as they include a LacZ gene.
# Fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, RFP, mCherry, etc.)

- GFP is very suitable because it is encoded by a single gene and because the encoded gene product is a fluorophore. So GFP doesn't require accessory co-factors or chaperones, but O2 for proper folding! 
- It's a small tag protein (27kDa), which makes it useful for translational fusions, as large tags tend to interfere with the proper functioning of the folded recombinant (target) protein. 
- It's not a metabolite and therefore doesn't require a biochemical pathway to produce it which allows it to be expressed in a wide variety of organisms. 
- It is used for in-vivo imaging and time-laps studies. 
- Mutation of the AA residues which form the chromophore change the fluorophores colour or stability which makes it useful for a vide variety of applications. 
- EGFP has improved folding efficiencies at 37Â°C which is useful for applications in mammalian applications.
- GFP is generally stable which makes it unsuited for dynamic gene expression studies (promoter activity), however there are GFP varieties with higher turnover rates (=lower half-lives). This can be achieved by mutations which provide sequences for protease cleavage or one can screen GFP sequence for SNPs that changes the stability of the protein. 
- Protein localization studies can be done with translational fusion of gfp. For this GFP has to be attached to the full gene

- The variety of different FP colours allows for the visualization of the localiztaion of various proteins at the same time.
