## High-Field Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry (FAIMS)
 

To alleviate the effects of interference (increased dynamic range & convergence of the quantitative ratios towards the median), [[several methods]] had been proposed to reduce or compensate for the effects of this ratio compression. FAIMS is a method for sseparating precursors by their ion mobilities through a strong electric field in the gas phase (Nitrogen). A bisinusoidal voltage separates the ions based on their __collisional cross section (CCS)__. The FAIMS technique can be seen as partially orthogonal to m/z and can be expected to distinguish between precursor ions even when they have similar observed m/z.

## Advantages
- FAIMS useful to reduce complexity of MS spectra
- Different __compensation voltage (CV)__ transfers specific ion population (special separation) generating cleaner MS/MS spectra more __Peptide Sequence Matches (PSM)__
- Specifically useful for chemical labeling approaches (TMT, iTRAQ). Results in more accurate quantification

This technique has the added advantage of increased speed as it operates in gaseous phase as opposed to condensed phase thus providing the orthogonal separation dimension with little to no time cost. 

In _Schweppe et al. 2019_ up to a 6-fold reduction in quantitative interference was observed using FAIMS __without sacrificing protein identification rates__. Using a TMT-interference standard they determined that FAIMS significantly improved the quantitative accuracy of multiplexed analyses.  

Being able to deal with the interference issue, this enables experiments that were previously unattractive for multiplexed quantification, including samples with high abundance peptides that elute across broad sections of the chromatogram(e.g. plasma or unfractionated lysates)
