# Measuring DNA concentration and purity
After purification we would like to asses the quality and quantity of our plasmid DNA
## Spectrophotometry
Spectrophoretic absorbance of DNA & RNA can be measured by a  __spectrophotometer__ such as __Nanodrop__. This is the PREFERRED method to assess abundance and purity!

The spectrophotometer gives an absorbance reading at OD260 and OD280 (or OD230) and the ratio between them. The OD260/OD280 ratio is used to assess the purity of DNA or RNA. If the ratio is much lower than 1.8, then impurities of the nature of [[EDTA]], carbohydrates, proteins, phenol, etc. are probably present as they absorb at around 280nm.

### Advantage
- Impurities can be detected

## Fluorescent dyes
Plasmids (nucleic acids in general) can be visualized with dyes which bind specifically to DNA & RNA

[[ratiometric dyes]] together with flow cytometry can indicate Calcium spikes
[[Fluorescent Reporters]]: Gene expression, growth rate
[[Fluorescent in situ Hybridisation (FISH)]]: Fluorescence microscopy, Identification

Markers can be separated by IRES sequences on the mRNA to expres the target gene and have an marker for successful insertion of the plasmid but without attaching it to the target. 

### Gel electrophoresis (Submarine gel)
- Gel electrophoresis separates nucleic acids in an agarose gel by an applied electrical field, exponentially inveresly proportional to their length. Small molecules travel further towards the positive charged cathode. 
- The fragment size is normally estimated using a standard ladder. Typically a __HindIII__ digestion of a lambda phage DNA is used as ladder.
- To visualize the DNA, __ethidium bromide (EtBr)__ is often used, a DNA intercalating dye that emits a strong fluorescence.
__Disdavantage:__ Very toxic (a mutagen)
Alternative dyes: GelRed or GelGreen from Biotium
- By preparing plasmids with a DNA bands created by electrophoresis can be excised out of the gel by under UV illumination or via [electroelution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroelution) (applying a current to move the DNA out of the gel). UV irradiation time must be minimized to avoid DNA damage! It is potentially possible to protect the DNA against UV damage by the addition of __cytidine or guanosine__ to the electrophoresis buffer. (D. Gründemann, 2018)

### Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
-  Is used to separate very large DNA molecules, as standard GE can't separate molecules which are larger than 15kbp long.
-  The __CHEF system (Contour-clamped Homogenous Electric Field)__ uses an electric field whose angle alternates between 60/-60° with the idea that larger molecules have a longer time to re-align with the change of direction and therefore travel less far. The ultimate travel direction however is still downwards in all cases. Can take up to 18h to run. 
-  Alternative systems: __OFAGE (Orthogonal Field Alteration Gel Electophoresis)__ and __FIGE (Field Inversion Gel Electophoresis)__

## Blotting techniques
Wikipedia:
A blot is a method of transferring DNA, RNA or proteins onto a carrier (for example, a [nitrocellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrocellulose "Nitrocellulose"), [polyvinylidene fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinylidene_fluoride) or [nylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon "Nylon") membrane). In many instances, this is done after gel electrophoresis, transferring the molecules from the gel onto the blotting membrane, and other times adding the samples directly onto the membrane.

### Different blotting types
- [[Southern Blot]]: Detection of DNA sequence
- [[Northern Blot]]: Detection of RNA (gene expression level)
- [Western Blot](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Western_blot)
- [[Colony hybridization probing]]
