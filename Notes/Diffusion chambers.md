Diffusion chambers for cultivation in the natural environment

An environmental extract is put on agar within a "metal ring", closed from bottom and top with membranes. Organisms can't excape, but molecules can. Put this back into the soil or wherever you want to isolate your microorganisms from, giving them the properties and importantly the metabolites from the environment that they need to grow. Once they have started to grow on the agar it sometimes is sufficient, so one can take them out and culture them outside this env.

On average you get 300 times more colonies in a diffusion chamber compared to petri dishes
