### RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends)
Primer extension by __reverse transcriptase__ is the first step, followed by the addition of a 3' PolyA-tail by __terminal transferase__. The PolyA-tail serves as a priming site, so that the cDNA can be amplified by PCR. The product is then cloned and sequenced to identify the transcription start sites. 

Originally, RACE could only be used for one transcript at the time, since it requires cloning. But, in combination with [[NGS]], which allows for the throughput of thousands of different RNA transcripts. 

The [[Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)|TdT Polymerase]] is being used for RACE.
