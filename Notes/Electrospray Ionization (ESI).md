The ion source consists of a spray capillary in which a high voltage is applied to create an aerosol.

Due to the high electric field present the solvent forms a so-called Taylor-cone, which happens when the surface tension is overcome by the electrostatic forces of the counter electrode at the inlet of the MS. At some point the jet becomes unstable and breaks up into smaller droplets (aerosol plume = electrospray). These droplets carry multiple charges and due to the __evaporation of the solvent__ the drop shrinks and the charge density increases until the point where the electrostatic repulsion becomes too strong (the droplet cant carry any more charges and it throws out and it throws out fine jets of liquid (__Rayleigh limit__). This leads to a droplet jet-fissions (Coulomb fissions) --> creation of  microdroplets. This process is repeated several times due to the solvent evaporation and ion desolvation. 

## Advantages
The big advantage with ESI is the availability of a soft ionization techn. that accomplishes the transfer of large molecules from a solution into the gas phase without breaking them (information is retained). This can be advantageous in the sense that the molecular ion (or more accurately a pseudo molecular ion) is almost always observed (quantification)

## Disadvantages
since there is very little fragmentation with soft ionization techniques, very little structural information can be gained from the simple mass spectrum obtained. This can be overcome by coupling ESI with MS2
