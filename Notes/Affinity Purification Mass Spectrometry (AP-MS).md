The AP-MS approach relies on expression of the target __bait protein__ coupled
with an __epitope tag__ or __antibodies__ targeting the endogenous bait protein, allowing purification of the bait protein together with the associating proteins (preys) by simple washing. This approach has been proven well suited for even large-scale high-throughput studies, and to yield __highly reproducible data__.

The most commonly used epitope tags in medium to large-scale studies include Strep, FLAG, His, MYC, HA and GFP, of which Strep-tag has become the gold-standard in affinity purification proteomics due to unparalleled protein purity under physiological conditions as well as the possibility for native competitive elution using biotin. 

## Applications
AP-MS can also be combined with quantitative proteomics approaches to better understand the __protein complex stoichiometry__ and the dynamics of __proteinâ€“complex (dis)assembly__. The combination of AP-MS with other techniques, such as biochemical fractionation, intact mass measurement and chemical crosslinking has been used to characterize supramolecular organization of protein complexes.
