Gateway Recombination Cloning is a recombination based cloning method where the DNA fragment is first placed into an intermediary Donor Vector from which one can further transfer the target DNA into various kinds of Entry Clones. As it inserts itself via homolgous recombination, the target gene is being exchanged.

For the first step it's required to add specific attB1&attB2 __recombination sites__ to the ends of the fragment. These are added via [[PCR]] amplification and can then be recombined with the compatible attP1&attP2 sites on the Donor Vector via the __BP clonase__. 
Now that your DNA fragment has been cloned into a donor plasmid, it can be rapidly shuttled into any compatible Gateway® Destination vector, which contain attR sites via LR clonase enzymes. Thousands of Gateway® destination plasmids have been made with different promoters, tags and fluorescent proteins. This allows you to do many different molecular biology techniques (such as fusing it with different tags, putting it under a variety of promoters and into backbones with different selection cassettes)

### Advantages
- Only one reaction
- Homologous recombination completely deletes the gene which is being replaced

### Disadvantages
- Leaves potentially unwanted sequences between ragments
