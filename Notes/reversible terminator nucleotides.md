Chemical structure of a fluorescently-labeled, reversibly chain-terminating dCTP analog. During synthesis the azide group (red arrow) blocks the 3'-OH group and prevents the incorporation of additional nucleotides into the growing strand. This group can be chemically removed to generate a 3'-OH group which then permits the incorporation of the next nucleotide. The moiety in blue is a chemically cleavable (black arrow) linker that attaches the fluorophore to the nucleotide. 

## Different forms of channel detection
- In __four-channel SBS__, bases are identified using four differen fluorescent dyes. Each type of base (A, C, T, G) carries a different color. Thus, four images in four channels are captured per cycle. This technology is used in __MiSeq__ and __HiSeq__ sequencers.

- __Two-channel SBS__ uses two fluorescent dyes and two images are captured per sequencing cycle using red and green filter bands. Thymines are labeled with a red, and adenines are labeled with both red and green fluorophores. Guanines are permanently dark. This technology is used in __MiniSeq__, __NextSeq__ and __NovaSeq__.

- The __one-channel SBS__ uses one dye, two chemistry steps and two imaging steps per sequencing cycle. Adenine has a removable label and is labeled in the first image only. Cytosine has a linker group that can bind a label and is labeled in the second image only. Thymine has a permanent fluorescent label and is therefore labeled in both images, and guanine is permanently dark. This technology is used in the [[iSeq 100 System]].
