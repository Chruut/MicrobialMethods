Although gene transcription is coupled to translation in bacteria, we can never be too sure about what is being actually being translated (= __Translatome__). 

A variation of RNA-seq can be used to analyze translated mRNAs.

mRNAs bound to ribosomes are captured, sequenced and then compared to the total mRNA amount.
