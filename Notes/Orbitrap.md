1) Ion source
2) S-lens (focuses the ion beam)
3) Bent quadrupole filters out uncharged particles (also called bent flatpole)
4) First filter of ions of certain m/z value
5) Octapole (Ion focussing)
6) C-trap (ion accumulation)--> "trap": N is used as a damping gas, to cool down and capture/ompact the ions
7) Optional fragmentation
8) [[Orbitrap Mass Analyzer]] (after going through a Z-lens)

With each compartement, there is a stepwise increase in vacuum.


## Advantages
- The Orbitrap MS (FTMS devices in general) features a high mass accuracy and resolution, that allow to make use of isotope experiments.
- The relative abundance of the isotopes of multi-isotopic elements (isotope patterns) give compositional information about a molecule. 


## Calculating the resolving power for distinguishing sulfur from carbon isotopes

R = m/Δm

R = Resolving power
m = theoretical value of target
Δm = difference in mass between the two features to be distinguished
