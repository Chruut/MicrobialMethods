__Codon bias__ means that your gene of interest uses unusual codons (special tRNAs required). To solve this problem you can adapt your gene sequence so that common tRNAs are used for translation (synthetic genes). Or you use special (E. coli) hosts expressing tRNAs which decode rare codons 
(e.g. __E. coli Rosetta (DE3)__ = "BL21 (DE3)" containing __pRARE__ or __BL21 (DE)CodonPLus__).
