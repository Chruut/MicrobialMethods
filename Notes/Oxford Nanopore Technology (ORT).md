- Tiny system, portable (fieldwork)

## Working Principle
- [[Porin protein]] (nanopore) is embedded in a membrane that separates two chambers containing electrolyte solutions
- A voltage applied acrosse this membrane pulls ions and the DNA strand through the pore
- The presence of the DNA in the pore restricts the flow of electrolyte ions in a way that depends on the base sequence of the DNA section that is currently traversing the pore. 
- Electrolyte current is used for sequence determination

## Advantages
- Very long reads (< 1Mb, 1mio) --> de novo genome assemblies
- High speed (500bp/sec) --> short run times
- low cost
- portable
- Detection of epigenetic modifications 

## Disadvantages
- High error rates (ca. 10%)
- Limited recycling of cells
- Frequent soft- and hardware updates

## Applications
- Long reads  --> De novo genome assemblies
- Epigenetic modifications
