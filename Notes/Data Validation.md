Data validation often gets forgotten. But since the data always is probabilistic, this is a very important step. Western Blotting techniques, enzymatic essays are orthogonal techniques to strengthen the findings. 

## Peptide detection
If an un-ambiguous peptide is identified, it is prove for the existence of the corresponding protein. The absence of an analyte, however, can't really be proven with proteomics. There are plenty of possible reasons for why a peptide wasn't identified:
- very low abundance, below the limit of detection
- difficult to digest
- doesn't fly well because of negative charges
- sticks to your eppendorf
- doesn't get extracted into your protein extract
