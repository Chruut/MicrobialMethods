# Identification of all species in a microbial community

## Cultivation-dependent methods (classical)
Isolation --> Identification

### Disadvantages
- Many different growth conditions have to be tested, logistical problem
- Many organisms grow on standard media
- Very tedious
- Fungi might not grow at all
- Preference for fast growing fungi tho

BUT!
The use of machine learning image recognition for the automated identification of cultures such as with the COPAN's PhenoMATRIX is in development.

It's currently very primitive requiring expensive chromogenic agars, but with time, it should work with non-chromogenic agars.

### Advantages
- You have the isolates available for further analyses
- Only living cells are analysed
## Molecular methods
- Basic principle: All microorganisms together at once
- Instead of isolating the organisms, only DNA/RNA is isolated with the danger that these could also originate from dead cells. 
- Not as expensive anymore, as sequencing costs are decreasing 
- Sequence data generate inventories of the microorganisms found and you get counts of each found barcode 

### Advantages
- Cultivation of "all" present species
- Independent of cultivation
- Rapid
### Disadvantages
- Unknown source of DNA
- DNA extraction and fragment amplification might not have the same efficiency in all the samples 

## Culturing of unculturable organisms
Classical:
- [[Diffusion chambers]]
- [[Isolation Chip (iChip)]]
Molecular:
- [[Single cell Genome Sequencing]] using microfluidic droplets

## Functional analysis
- Instead of barcodes the interest in functional analysis lies in the genome as this gives information about metabolic functions present in the community.
- __rRNA__ gives information about __active organisms__ in the sample. 
- __mRNA__ gives information about __active functions__ in the sample (active genes)
- There are stains to distinguish gram+/- organisms
- [[Fluorescent in situ Hybridisation (FISH)]]
- [[Combinatorial Labling and Spectral Imaging (CLASI)]]
### Distinguish Alive/Dead
- [[Stable isotope cultivation]]
- [[Quantitative Stable Isotope Probing (qSIP)]]
- [[Dead staining]]
