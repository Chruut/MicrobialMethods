- pAM34 plasmid can be used to assess the growthrate of a bacterial population. The plasmid carries an antibiotic resistance cassette and only propagates with cell divisions if induced with IPTG. 
- If you leave IPTG away, the plasmid is going to be diluted --> a smaller fraction of the population will be resistant to the AB. 
- Selective plating allows to backcalculate the frequency of the population which still has the plasmid. A population which has a higher growth rate will have a lower number of survivors relative to its total population size.
