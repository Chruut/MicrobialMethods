BioID relies on the __biotin ligase__ (BirA of E. coli) feature of attaching __biotin__ to proteins (__biotinylation__). Biotin ligase is fused to the bait protein (protein of interest) and then introduced into the environment of interest where it will biotinylate vicinal proteins (within a radius of ~10nm) upon supplementation of biotin. It leaves a trace at whichever protein interacted with the bait. Biotinylated proteins can then be selectively __isolated__ and identified by conventional methods, most notably __mass spectrometry__. Enables increased coverage of interaction partners. Not limited to direct binders but can also capture weak and/or transient interactions. 

For the successful incubation with Biotin (sometimes ATP), time and concentration must be optimized
Enrichment and analysis of biotinylated proteins
Appropriate negative control is important
