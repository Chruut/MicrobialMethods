## Stable isotope-labeling methods
(https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ac048455k)
Accurate relative quantification for __abundance comparison of the same protein__ in different samples can be realized by incorporation of stable isotopes into the samples. Stable isotopes are generally introduced into proteins or peptides by chemical modification, metabolic labeling, or enzymatic derivatization. By using a variety of available labeling reagents one can introduce individual mass shifts which allow specific identification. In this type of experiment, an amino acid, such as 35S-methionine, is incorporated in the culture medium of the growing cell(s). As proteins are synthesized, 35S-methionine is incorporated into the cellular proteins. Based on the extent of incorporation of the radiolabel, the absolute amount of the peptide or protein can be determined.

This is utilized in methods like [SILAC](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12118079/), [cICAT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12766231/), or [18 O-labeling] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10918372/). 

## Disadvantages
- Requires complex, time-consuming sample preparation and can be relatively expensive while the comparison of the abundance between different proteins also is not possible!
- Can be deleterious to the subject under study. Consequently determining absolute quantification of proteins using radiolabel techniques is limited to expendable biological systems such as microbes, plants, and cell cultures.
- As the number of samples increases, so does the complexity of the MS1 spectrum.
