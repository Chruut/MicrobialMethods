- __Pfu__ is ha high fidelity pol as it has a 3'->5' proof-reading exonuclease activity and therefore has a lower mutation rate than Taq and consequently has a lower extension rate.
- __Taq__ adds a 3' overhanging A. This is used in [[TA cloning (=Rapid cloning)]]
- __Tth__ is used for reverse transcription ([[RT-PCR]]) (also accepts RNA as template)
- __KOD1__ has a high extension rate and a fairly low mutation rate
- The high end enzymes are typically used for PCR amplification of long sequences.
